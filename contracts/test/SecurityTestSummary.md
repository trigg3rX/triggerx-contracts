## Security Test Patterns Used

### 1. Access Control Testing

```solidity
function test_Security_OnlyOwnerCanFunction() public {
    vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(OwnableUpgradeable.OwnableUnauthorizedAccount.selector, attacker));
    vm.prank(attacker);
    contract.privilegedFunction();
}
```

### 2. Reentrancy Testing

```solidity
contract MaliciousReentrant {
    function attack() external {
        target.vulnerableFunction();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (callCount < 3) {
            target.vulnerableFunction();
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Parameter Validation Testing

```solidity
function test_Security_RejectsInvalidParameters() public {
    vm.expectRevert("Invalid parameter");
    contract.functionWithValidation(invalidParam);
}
```

### 4. State Manipulation Testing

```solidity
function test_Security_StateIntegrity() public {
    // Perform operations
    // Verify state remains consistent
    assertEq(expectedState, actualState);
}
```

### 5. Cross-chain Message Testing

```solidity
function test_Security_InvalidMessage() public {
    Origin memory invalidOrigin = Origin({
        srcEid: uint32(99999),
        sender: bytes32(0),
        nonce: uint64(0)
    });

    vm.expectRevert("Invalid source chain");
    contract.lzReceive(invalidOrigin, bytes32(0), payload, address(0), bytes(""));
}
```

### 6. Fee Buffer Testing

```solidity
function test_Security_FeeBufferProtection() public {
    // Test that fee buffer prevents underfunded transactions
    uint256 estimatedFee = contract.estimateFee(action, operator);
    uint256 feeWithBuffer = estimatedFee + (estimatedFee * 10) / 100;

    // Verify buffer is applied correctly
    assertTrue(feeWithBuffer > estimatedFee);

    // Test insufficient balance handling
    vm.deal(address(contract), estimatedFee); // Only exact fee, no buffer
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit MessageFailed(dstEid, bytes32(0), "Insufficient balance for message fee (with 10% buffer)");
}
```

### 7. Low Balance Alert Testing

```solidity
function test_Security_LowBalanceAlert() public {
    uint256 threshold = contract.lowBalanceThreshold();
    vm.deal(address(contract), threshold - 1);

    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit LowBalanceAlert(threshold - 1, threshold);
    contract.checkLowBalance();
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Known Limitations

1. Some tests depend on proper mock setup and may fail with inadequate mocking
2. Cross-chain tests require proper peer configuration
3. Reentrancy tests may need specific contract configurations
4. Fee buffer tests require accurate gas price simulation
5. Low balance tests need proper network threshold configuration

## Conclusion

This security test suite provides comprehensive coverage of potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities across all TriggerX contracts. The recent enhancements significantly improve the protocol's resilience against fee-based attacks, operational failures, and cross-chain messaging issues.

The new fee buffer system, enhanced error handling, and proactive monitoring capabilities represent a significant security upgrade that addresses real-world operational challenges while maintaining the protocol's decentralized and trustless nature.

Regular execution of these tests during development helps maintain security standards and catch regressions early in the development cycle. The enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities ensure that operational issues can be detected and addressed proactively, improving overall system reliability.
